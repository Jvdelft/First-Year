# First Year Projects
Those are my first year of Bachelor projects. One should note that everything is in French as it was the first year of study.

# Autonomous Car
The project was made of an autonomous car able to read signs and follow the road. In that sense, the car was equipped with a Raspberry Pi with a Camera and an Arduino for sensors.
The folder contains the codes, presentation and report for more informations.

# Python Poker Game
This is the first time I had to deal with coding. The idea was to create a simple poker game using Python. A the beginning of the game, each player received two cards and chose to bet or not as a real poker game.
The code can be found in the folder.
